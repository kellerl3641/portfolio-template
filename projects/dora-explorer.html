            <h1 class="margin text-center">Dora-The-Explorer Project</h1>
          <p><b>Context</b>

Mr. Mueller, my SEP 10 teacher, told us to make a project on any adventure that we can think of. This project requires a partner to work with. The title of Adventure is "Dora The Explorer. My partner and I created several different unique names for our character, but Swiper stood out the most to us.</p>
          <h2>Content</h2>
          <p>Our project is consist of 4 characters which are "Dora, Wiper, Diego and the Map" It has many links that can take you anywhere you choose and at the end of the game, there would be a surprise. Our Project was based on using links and using Github command lines in order to make the files and apply links to every file.</p>
          <h3>Self Reflection</h3>
          <p>My Teacher assigned this Projects for us to practice more with Github Command lines and The most challenging I have gone through was planning on what movie my partner and I should create. There's a million of ideas we can choose and sometimes it can be overwhelming. Another challenge I faced was collaborating with my partner outside of the school building. There were some times either my partner or myself would be occupied with something else.
          If I had to continue, I would have explored and went on with the story more.</p>
